# Position Limits & Asset Allocation Framework

This reference file defines the investment strategy framework for the 4-asset portfolio (MSFT, QQQ, TSLA, GLD).

## Two-Layer Capital Structure

| Layer | Purpose | Target Allocation | Role |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **Risk Layer** | Active trading capital in equity positions | 60-70% | Executes interval buying strategy, holds all stock positions |
| **Safe Layer** | Cash reserves and money market funds | 30-40% | Provides liquidity, psychological safety, re-entry capital |

**Key Principle**: Only capital "withdrawn" to the Safe Layer is considered realized profit. Unrealized gains stay in Risk Layer.

## Asset Position Limits (% of Risk Layer Only)

| Symbol | Asset Type | Max Position | Strategic Role | Buy Conditions |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **MSFT** | Core Holding | ≤35% | Long-term growth foundation | Buy on pullbacks, hold through volatility |
| **QQQ** | Rhythm Position | ≤30% | Index exposure, DCA layer | Dollar-cost averaging + interval buying |
| **TSLA** | Tactical Position | ≤15% | High-beta growth play | Only buy on technical corrections |
| **GLD** | Defensive Position | ≤15% | Hedging and safe haven | Static holding, never chase |

## Position Management Rules

### Absolute Limits
- **Never exceed** the position limits listed above
- Calculate position % as: `(Asset Total Cost) / (Risk Layer Total) × 100`
- Risk Layer Total = Sum of all positions + available cash for trading

### Building Positions
- **MSFT**: Primary accumulation target, can build to 35% over time
- **QQQ**: Secondary position, combines DCA with opportunistic adds
- **TSLA**: Defensive building only, requires clear technical entry
- **GLD**: Static allocation, maintain 10-15% baseline

### When Approaching Limits
- **At 90% of limit**: Reduce order sizes
- **At 95% of limit**: Switch to observation mode
- **At 100% of limit**: Stop all new orders for that asset

## Three Market Phases & Position Behavior

### Phase 1: Downtrend (Price < 5-Day SMA × 0.97)
- **Action**: Most aggressive accumulation period
- **Order Intervals**: Wide (5%, 10%, 15% below current)
- **Quantities**: Full position sizes allowed
- **Psychology**: Highest anxiety but most productive phase

### Phase 2: Consolidation (Price within ±3% of 5-Day SMA)
- **Action**: Selective accumulation with tight intervals
- **Order Intervals**: Conservative (2%, 4%, 6% below current)
- **Quantities**: Standard position sizes
- **Psychology**: Patience test - let market decide fills

### Phase 3: Uptrend (Price > 5-Day SMA × 1.03)
- **Action**: Observation mode - minimal to no buying
- **Order Intervals**: None or extremely conservative
- **Quantities**: Reduced or zero
- **Psychology**: Most comfortable but lowest activity

## Portfolio Rebalancing Triggers

### Quarterly Review
- Evaluate if Risk/Safe layer ratio within 60-70% / 30-40% target
- Assess if any single position exceeds comfortable limits
- Consider "withdrawing" profits to Safe Layer if Risk Layer >75%

### When to Transfer to Safe Layer
- Risk Layer shows 10-12% unrealized gains
- Risk Layer allocation exceeds 75% of total capital
- Strong uptrend phase with limited buy opportunities

### Re-Entry from Safe Layer
- Only during downtrend or deep correction phases
- Maintain Safe Layer minimum of 30% for psychological stability

## Long-Term Philosophy

> **"Rhythm over prediction"** - We design responses to market movements, not predictions

- Position size reflects conviction AND market phase
- Empty cash position = anxiety trigger (maintain 30%+ buffer)
- Execution quality > Entry price perfection
- Observation value > Transaction frequency
